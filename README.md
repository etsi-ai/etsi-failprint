# failprint

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/etsi-failprint.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/etsi-failprint/)

**failprint** is an MLOps-first diagnostic tool that performs automatic root cause analysis on your ML model's failure patterns.

It segments, clusters, and correlates failed predictions with input data features — surfacing **which features are contributing to failure**, **which data segments fail the most**, and **how drift or imbalance may be related to model degradation**.

## 🚀 Installation

```sh
pip install etsi-failprint
```

---

## ⚡ Example Prerequisites

To run the example scripts, install these packages:

```sh
pip install pandas scikit-learn seaborn
```

These are required to:

- 📊 Handle tabular data (`pandas`)  
- 🤖 Use ML tools and utilities (`scikit-learn`)  
- 🧬 Load example datasets like `iris`, `titanic` (`seaborn`)  

> 📌 **Note:** These dependencies are only needed for examples and demos. If you're using `etsi-failprint` in your own pipeline, you likely already have these installed.


---

## 🏁 Quick Start

```python
import pandas as pd
from etsi.failprint import analyze

# Sample inputs
X = pd.DataFrame({
    "feature1": [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4],
    "feature2": [10, 15, 14, 13, 12, 13, 20],
    "category": ["A", "B", "B", "B", "C", "C", "A"]
})
y_true = pd.Series([1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0])
y_pred = pd.Series([1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1])

# Analyze misclassifications
report = analyze(X, y_true, y_pred, output="markdown", cluster=True)
print(report)
```

## 📊 What It Does

- Segments failures by input feature values (numerical/categorical)
- Highlights overrepresented values in failure cases
- Clusters similar failure samples for pattern recognition
- Writes log files and markdown reports for audit or CI/CD
- Compatible with MLOps tools (like MLflow, DVC, Airflow, Watchdog)

## 📚 Documentation

- [Getting Started Guide](docs/getting_started.md)
- [Example: Titanic Dataset](examples/titanic_workflow.py)
- [Example: Iris Dataset with Pipeline](examples/iris_pipeline.py)
- [Example: Wine Dataset with Random Forest](examples/wine_random_forest.py)

The example scripts will print a markdown report to your terminal and may also generate a file in the `reports/` folder.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- **Can’t activate venv?**  
  Try:  
  ```sh
  Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
  ```
- **ModuleNotFoundError?**  
  Make sure your virtual environment is activated and run:  
  ```sh
  pip install pandas scikit-learn seaborn
  ```
- **Report not generating?**  
  Ensure your working directory is correct and that the `reports/` folder exists.

## 💡 Future Contribution Ideas

We welcome community contributions! Here are some ideas for future enhancements:

- **Integration with additional MLOps platforms**  
  Extend compatibility to more tools (e.g., Kubeflow, ZenML, Flyte) to streamline diagnostics in diverse ML pipelines.

- **Advanced visualization dashboards**  
  Add interactive dashboards (e.g., via Streamlit or Dash) for exploring failure patterns and root causes visually.

- **Explainability integrations**  
  Incorporate explainability libraries (e.g., SHAP, LIME) to provide feature attribution for failure segments.

- **Support for unstructured data**  
  Enable analysis of failures in NLP and CV models by integrating embedding-based clustering and drift detection.

- **Plugin system for custom analyses**  
  Allow users to add custom scripts or modules for domain-specific failure analysis.

- **Expanded documentation and tutorials**  
  Add more real-world examples, troubleshooting guides, and video walkthroughs to help new users get started quickly.
